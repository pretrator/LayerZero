# GitHub Actions Automation Status

## ‚úÖ Setup Complete!

Your GitHub Actions workflow is **already configured and committed**. It will work **100% automatically**.

---

## How It Works Automatically

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ You Do (2 commands):
```bash
make bump-patch    # Creates version 0.1.4 + tag v0.1.4
make release       # Pushes tag to GitHub
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ GitHub Does Everything Else (AUTOMATIC):
```
‚úÖ Tag detected: v0.1.4
‚úÖ Workflow started automatically
‚úÖ Package built automatically  
‚úÖ Published to PyPI automatically
‚úÖ GitHub release created automatically
```

**You don't click anything on GitHub. It just happens!**

---

## Verification

### Your Workflow File:
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` ‚úÖ
- **Committed**: Yes ‚úÖ
- **Pushed to GitHub**: Yes ‚úÖ

### Trigger Configuration:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'    ‚Üê Triggers on v0.1.4, v1.2.3, etc.
```

### Current Status:
```bash
$ git log --oneline -1 -- .github/workflows/release.yml
247aa93 Minor changes    ‚Üê Already committed ‚úÖ
```

---

## What Happens When You Release

### Step 1: Run Locally
```bash
$ make bump-patch
bumpversion patch
[main abc123] Bump version: 0.1.3 ‚Üí 0.1.4
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
$ make release
git push
git push --tags
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/LayerZero.git
 * [new tag]         v0.1.4 -> v0.1.4
```

### Step 3: Watch GitHub (AUTOMATIC)

Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LayerZero/actions

You'll see:

```
üü° Release - v0.1.4
   Running...
   
   ‚úÖ Checkout code          (5s)
   ‚úÖ Set up Python          (10s)
   ‚úÖ Install dependencies   (15s)
   ‚úÖ Build package          (8s)
   üîÑ Publish to PyPI        (running...)
```

Then after ~1 minute:

```
‚úÖ Release - v0.1.4
   Completed successfully
   
   ‚úÖ Checkout code
   ‚úÖ Set up Python
   ‚úÖ Install dependencies
   ‚úÖ Build package
   ‚úÖ Publish to PyPI
   ‚úÖ Create GitHub Release
   
   Duration: 1m 23s
```

### Step 4: Verify It Worked

1. **Check PyPI**:
   https://pypi.org/project/LayerZero/0.1.4/

2. **Check GitHub Releases**:
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LayerZero/releases

3. **Test Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install LayerZero==0.1.4
   ```

## Before First Release: Add PyPI Token

**One-time setup** (if not done yet):

1. Get PyPI token:
   - Go to: https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
   - Click: "Add API token"
   - Name: "LayerZero GitHub Actions"
   - Scope: "Entire account" (or project-specific)
   - Copy token (starts with `pypi-...`)

2. Add to GitHub:
   - Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LayerZero/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click: "New repository secret"
   - Name: `PYPI_API_KEY`
   - Value: Paste your PyPI token
   - Click: "Add secret"

---

## Testing Without Publishing

To test the automation without publishing to PyPI:

### Option 1: Dry Run Locally
```bash
# See what would happen
bumpversion --dry-run --verbose patch
```

### Option 2: Test on a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b test-release
make bump-patch
make release
# Watch GitHub Actions run
# Won't affect main branch
```

### Option 3: Use TestPyPI

Temporarily modify `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
```yaml
# Line 33, change to:
run: python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

Then release normally. It publishes to TestPyPI instead of real PyPI.

---

## Monitoring Releases

### Watch Live:
1. Push tag: `make release`
2. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LayerZero/actions
3. See workflow running in real-time
4. Click on run for detailed logs

### Email Notifications:
GitHub sends email if workflow fails automatically.

### Workflow Badge:
Add to README.md:
```markdown
![Release](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LayerZero/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)
```

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: "Does it run on every commit?"
**No.** Only when you push a version tag (v*.*.*).

### Scenario: "What if I push a branch?"
**Nothing.** The workflow only triggers on tags.

### Scenario: "What if I create a tag manually?"
**It runs!** Any tag matching v*.*.* triggers it.

### Scenario: "Can I cancel a running release?"
**Yes.** Go to Actions tab, click the running workflow, click "Cancel workflow run".

### Scenario: "What if PyPI upload fails?"
**GitHub Actions fails**, but your code is still pushed. You can:
- Fix the issue (check PYPI_API_KEY)
- Delete the tag: `git push origin :v0.1.4`
- Try again: `make bump-patch && make release`

---

## Summary

### ‚úÖ Already Done:
- Workflow file created
- Workflow file committed
- Workflow file pushed to GitHub
- Automatic trigger configured

### üîê Need Once:
- Add `PYPI_API_KEY` secret to GitHub

### üöÄ To Release:
```bash
make bump-patch && make release
```

**That's it! Everything else is automatic.**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add PyPI token** (if not done):
   - Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New secret
   - Name: `PYPI_API_KEY`

2. **Test it**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure working directory is clean
   git status
   
   # Bump version and release
   make bump-patch
   make release
   
   # Watch on GitHub
   # https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LayerZero/actions
   ```

3. **Celebrate!** üéâ
   Your package is now on PyPI automatically.
